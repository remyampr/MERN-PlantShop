* multer is a middleware used for handling file uploads in Node.js applications. It is not built into Node.js, so we have to install it separately via npm install multer.
This line imports multer to use its file-uploading functionality.
* import path from 'path';
path is a built-in Node.js module that provides utilities to work with file and directory paths.
Here, we are using it to ensure that the file's extension is correctly added when we rename the uploaded file.


 const app = express();
express() creates an instance of an Express application.
app now refers to your server that will handle incoming HTTP requests and manage routes.


/my-app
  /client               # React frontend
  /server               # Backend folder
    /models             # Mongoose models (for database schemas)
    /uploads            # Folder to store images
    server.js           # Entry point for your server


import express from 'express';
import multer from 'multer';
import path from 'path';

// Create a new Express app
const app = express();

// Set up Multer storage configuration
const storage = multer.diskStorage({
  destination: (req, file, cb) => {
    // Specify the folder to store images
    cb(null, 'uploads/');
    // Folder where the uploaded files will be saved
    <!-- The uploads/ folder is the location on the server where the files will be saved when users upload them. -->
  },
  filename: (req, file, cb) => {
    // Rename the file with a timestamp to avoid duplicates
    cb(null, Date.now() + path.extname(file.originalname));
  }
});

// Create an upload instance with the storage configuration
const upload = multer({ storage: storage });


// Middleware to serve static files (images) from the 'uploads' folder
app.use('/uploads', express.static('uploads'));


multer.diskStorage() is a method that defines how the uploaded files should be stored and named.
storage here is an object that holds the configuration for how Multer will handle file uploads (like where to save the file and how to name it).
The diskStorage() method takes an object with two properties: destination and filename. Letâ€™s look at each one:

destination: (req, file, cb) => { cb(null, 'uploads/'); },
defines the folder where the uploaded file will be stored.
* req is the request object.
* file is the uploaded file.
* cb is a callback function to signal completion.
'uploads/': This is the directory where files will be stored. If the directory does not exist, Multer will try to create it, or you must ensure it is already there.
filename: (req, file, cb) => { cb(null, Date.now() + path.extname(file.originalname)); },
filename defines how the uploaded file should be named.
(req, file, cb):
req is the request object.
file is the uploaded file object.
file.originalname: This is the original name of the file (e.g., image.jpg).
path.extname(file.originalname): This method from the path module extracts the file extension (like .jpg or .png) from the original file name.
Date.now(): This generates a timestamp (current time in milliseconds) and helps avoid file name conflicts. It ensures the file name will be unique by prepending the timestamp.


If the uploaded file is image.jpg, it might get saved as 1616173735937.jpg (where 1616173735937 is the timestamp). This avoids overwriting files if multiple files have the same name.

* const upload = multer({ storage: storage });
upload is a Multer instance that uses the storage configuration defined earlier.
This upload instance will handle the actual file uploads.
When you use upload in a route, it will handle file uploads according to the storage configuration (where to store the file and what to name it).

* app.use('/uploads', express.static('uploads'));
express.static('uploads') is a built-in middleware in Express that allows you to serve static files (e.g., images, CSS, JavaScript).
app.use('/uploads', ...):
This tells your Express app to serve static files from the uploads/ directory.
Any file uploaded and stored in the uploads/ folder can be accessed via a URL like http://localhost:5000/uploads/filename.jpg.


express.static: Makes files publicly available from a specific directory (like uploads/), so they can be accessed through URLs.


<!-- app.use('/uploads', express.static('uploads'));  -->
is used to serve static files (like images, videos, or any other files) in your Express app. Let me break it down step by step to explain what each part does:
* app.use() is a method in Express that sets up middleware functions.
A middleware function in Express is a function that gets executed during the request-response cycle, usually before sending the response to the client.
In this case, you're using app.use() to tell Express to handle requests for static files.

*  '/uploads' This is the URL path that clients will use to access the files.
When a user requests a URL that starts with /uploads, Express will look for the file in the 'MyUploads' folder on the server.
Example: If you have an image file image.jpg inside the 'uploads' folder, users can access it at http://yourdomain/uploads/image.jpg.

*  express.static('uploads')
express.static() is a built-in middleware function that tells Express to serve files from a specific folder on the server.


<!--  -->
app.post('/api/plants', upload.single('image'), async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { name, description, price, category, waterLevel, sunlightLevel, easeOfCare, fertilization } = req.body;
    const imagePath = req.file ? `/uploads/${req.file.filename}` : null;

    // Create a new plant instance and save it to the database
    const newPlant = new Plant({
      name,
      description,
      price,
      image: imagePath,   // Store the image path
      category,
      waterLevel,
      sunlightLevel,
      easeOfCare,
      fertilization,
    });

    await newPlant.save();

    // Respond with the saved plant
    res.status(201).json(newPlant);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    res.status(500).json({ message: 'Error adding plant' });
  }
});
upload.single('image'): This is middleware from multer that handles file uploads.

.single('image') tells Multer that you expect a single file upload in the field named image (this is where the client sends the image as part of the form).
req.body: This contains the other plant details (like name, description, price, etc.) sent by the client in the body of the request.

req.file: If a file is uploaded, it will be available in req.file. Multer handles storing the file and assigning the file's metadata (like filename, path, etc.) to req.file.
imagePath: The imagePath stores the relative URL to access the uploaded image. For example, if the file is stored in the uploads/ directory, the path will look like /uploads/filename.jpg.

newPlant.save(): This saves the new plant object to your MongoDB database.

Response: After saving the plant, a success response with the plant data is sent to the client.
upload.single('image') is telling Multer that we expect a single file to be uploaded with the field name image.
It will take care of:
Saving the uploaded file to the designated folder (in your case, MyUploads/).
Adding the file metadata (e.g., filename) to req.file.
After Multer processes the file, your controller will execute, and the image's metadata will be available in req.file.
You'll use that metadata (like the filename) to store the image path in the database (for example, /uploads/filename.jpg).
